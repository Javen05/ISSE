# Setup-Windows-on-VM
A school project where I had to configure and setup Windows 10 on an Oracle Virtual Machine.

<br>
In this project, I 
1) configured a Windows OS from scratch, 
2) Setup Accounts and Groups on the Virtual Machine, 
3) restrict permissions of Groups to their respective files, 
4) configured a Virtual Machine Setup according to given specifications and 
5) edited several Local Group Policies and Rules.

6) The VM was configured to interact with my Host Laptop, 
with Protocols like Inbound rules, 
Enabling/Disabled Firewall Restrictions and 
File Transfer Protocol with IIS.

7) Lastly, I ran CIS Benchmark test to discover previously unbeknownst vulnerabilities and patched 
them accordingly. Once policies were changed, a final test is run, and that concludes the end of 
this assignment.
