# Setup-Windows-on-VM
A school project where I had to configure and setup Windows 10 on an Oracle Virtual Machine.

<br>
In this project, I 
<br>1) configured a Windows OS from scratch, 
<br>2) Setup Accounts and Groups on the Virtual Machine, 
<br>3) restrict permissions of Groups to their respective files, 
<br>4) configured a Virtual Machine Setup according to given specifications and 
<br>5) edited several Local Group Policies and Rules.
<br>
<br>
6) The VM was configured to interact with my Host Laptop, 
<br>with Protocols like Inbound rules, 
<br>Enabling/Disabled Firewall Restrictions and 
<br>File Transfer Protocol with IIS.
<br>
<br>
7) Lastly, I ran CIS Benchmark test to discover previously unbeknownst vulnerabilities and patched 
<br>them accordingly. Once policies were changed, a final test is run, and that concludes the end of 
<br>this assignment.
